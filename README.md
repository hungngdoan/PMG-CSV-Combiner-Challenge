# PMG-CSV-Combiner-Challenge
This is my submission for the CSV Combiner Challenge from PMG. Applied Position: Graduate Leadership Program - Data &amp; Technology

Full name: Nguyen An Hung Doan
Emaik: h.doan@tcu.edu
Position applied: Graduate Leadership Program - Data & Technology
Date: 02/04/2022
Note: The following program solves the CSV Combiner challenge.
    I developed this program on a Windows 10 computer and
    used Anaconda/Window command line interface to execute the program.

    Instead of using the original command line to run, please use the following:
        python csv-combiner-Doan.py accessories.csv clothing.csv household_cleaners.csv > combined.csv
    
    I already included the 'fixtures' folder name in the sourcePath (line 44)
    Assumption: the default output file head will have: "email_hash", "category", "filename"
